<p><strong>Parasocial Interaction:</strong>
<em>An exposure that garners interest in a persona and becomes a parasocial relationship after repeated exposure to the media persona causes the media user to develop illusions of intimacy, friendship, and identification.</em></p>

<p>I was 20 in 2012. I‚Äôd broken up with my first girlfriend and was basking in a delightful void.</p>
<p>I discovered Joe Rogan, and I‚Äôd listen to him talk with guests on his podcast.</p>
<p>It felt like I had friends over, sitting in my living room joining the sesh.</p>
<p>Joe was cool. A fighter. A comedian. His lifestyle. His whacky friends. It was beyond reality TV. I imagined being on his show, rehearsing in my head what I would say.</p>
<p>Joe‚Äôs persona was a powerful projection as I navigated my smoke-filled chasm of early audulthood.</p>

<p>10 years later. 2022. I‚Äôm back in the void. In a new city. My social circle has shrunk, so to fill the gap I reconnect with my old friend: Joe.</p>
<p>My YouTube feed is filled with clips of Joe and his comedian friends having a merry time talking and cracking jokes.</p>
<p>I suspend my disbelief as I potter around the house, and in moments they feel like my friends too.</p>
<p>Then it hits me:</p>
<h4 id="i-am-observing-media-for-companionship">I am observing media for companionship.</h4>
<h3 id="i-have-begun-to-substitute-social-interaction-with-parasocial-interaction">I have begun to substitute social interaction with parasocial interaction.</h3>

<p>Thinking back to 20-year-old Liam and the present 30-year-old Liam; there is a pattern. A pattern that hooks me into an overconsumption of content:</p>
<p><strong>The experience of socializing with someone who has a thing I desire.</strong></p>
<p>I can‚Äôt unsee this now. It‚Äôs everywhere</p>
<p>I want to go deeper‚Ä¶ throughout history‚Ä¶ to see the persistence of this pattern through space and time.</p>

<p>F.R.I.E.N.D.S exemplifies how parasocial relationships were developed using television.</p>

<em><div align="center"> Chandler and Co are here to distract you from the void. </div></em></p>
<p>90‚Äôs sitcoms transpired in apartments, where the audience would sit and watch TV after work, a ritual that fueled enduring parasocial interactions with the show.</p>
<p>The audience returns home deflated and socially isolated from living in a soul-crushing metropolis. F.R.I.E.N.D.S gives them social experiences with a communal, upbeat group of attractive (and incestuous) friends.</p>
<p>F.R.I.E.N.D.S is a perfect projection of the audience‚Äôs desires.</p>
<p><img src="/images/joe-rogan/844d8514-64e3-46ab-b942-51bd67bae915_1454x1258.webp" alt="">
<em><div align="center"> ‚ô´ I&rsquo;ll be there for you ‚ô´  </div></em></p>
<p>The opening song ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Be There For You‚Äù acknowledges the audience‚Äôs suffering and that the show will be there for [them], to relieve their existential dread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ô´</p>
<p>So no one told you life was gonna be this way<br>
Your job&rsquo;s a joke, you&rsquo;re broke, your love life&rsquo;s D.O.A. (Dead On Arrival)<br>
It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re always stuck in second gear<br>
When it hasn&rsquo;t been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, but&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be there for you<br>
When the rain starts to pour üò≠<br>
I&rsquo;ll be there for you<br>
(Like I&rsquo;ve been there before)<br>
I&rsquo;ll be there for you<br>
(&lsquo;Cause you&rsquo;re there for me too)</p>
<p>‚ô´</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The simulation of socializing with people who have something we desire.</p>
<p>Repeated interactions with the media are reinforced by ritual.</p>

<p>Before TV, muscular heroes would appear episodically on the newsstands and dominate mass media. They were more accessible and engaging than books and exploded in popularity during the 1940s and 1950s.</p>
<p>The heroes presented a persona in possession of things the audience, typically young boys desire: muscular strength, courage, and power.</p>

<em><div align = "center" >Squint your eyes and it‚Äôs a podcast about MMA.</div></em></p>
<p>Readers quickly bonded to their favorite hero and habitually returned to buy the latest issue to resolve the cliffhanger from the previous episode.</p>

<p>The heroes‚Äô world-saving optimism was a source of hope amidst a society recovering from the great depression.</p>

<p>Before mass media, parasocial relationships were fostered through ceremonies, routine, and religious worship. The media personas of this era were gods, heroes, prophets, philosophers, and kings.</p>
<p>The masses were told stories of these personas from speakers in close physical proximity.</p>

<p><em><strong><div align = "center" >Jesus blowing up his follower count during the Sermon on the Mount.</div></strong></em></p>
<p>The greeks had gods such as Zeus, Athena, and heroes like Hercules. A rich menagerie of personas appealed to and created bonds with the audiences and became interwoven into the social order.</p>
<p>Eastern cultures produced devotion to personas such as the Hindu deities which due to their religious-based interactions, hold cultural relevance to this day.</p>

<p>We return to 2022, where I sit and watch clips of Joe and his comedian friends.</p>
<p>Are parasocial relationships good or bad?</p>
<p>At one end of the spectrum, it is entertainment, a way to relax. On the other end, the consumption of personas strengthen a coping strategy that restrains positive action to improve your situation.</p>
<p>In my case the answer (projection) is clear:</p>
<p><strong>I need to get off my iPad, leave my apartment and socialize with people at the local comedy club.</strong></p>
